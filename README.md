Install
=======

Setup the environment

```
virtualenv env-ml
source  env-ml/bin/activate
pip install keras
pip install tensorflow-gpu
pip install sklearn
pip install pandas
```

Install ROOT from src
https://root.cern.ch/downloading-root

Let's assume ROOT is installed under ```$HOME/local/root```

Clone repository

```
git clone https://gitlab.cern.ch/disipio/AngryTops
```

Execute
=======

```
module load cuda/9.0.176
module load cudnn
source $HOME/env-ml/bin/activate
source $HOME/local/root/bin/thisroot.sh 
```

Format of csv File
=====
- Each row represents a different event. The axis for each entry are as follows:
Number of Jets | Number of B Jets Tagged | Lepton P_x | Lepton P_y | Lepton P_z | Lepton Energy | Missing Transverse Energy | 
Missing Phi | Jet1 P_x | ... | Jet1 P_z | !!Jet1 E!! | !!Jet1 M!! | Jet1 BTag | ... | Jet5 P_z | !!Jet5 E!! | !!Jet5 M!! | Jet5 BTag | W_had P_x | ... | W_had P_z | W_had E | W_had M | | W_lep P_x | ... | W_lep P_x | ... | W_lep P_z | W_lep E | W_lep M | ... | <b_had> | <b_lep> | <t_had> | <t_lep> | 

Note: Most quantities are unchanged from the ROOT Tree generated by Delphes, except that we round to three decimal places, and we multiply Lepton Energy by 10e9 before saving it into the tree. 

Note: I think the units in my CSV file are actually incorrect (in particular, for p_x, p_y and p_z). Likely occurred
